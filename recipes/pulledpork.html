    <h6>This is the pulled pork you will be making</h6>
    <p>
        Pulled pork is a beloved barbecue staple that originates from the Southern United States. Traditionally made from pork shoulder or pork butt, this dish is celebrated for its tender, flavorful meat that practically melts in your mouth. The secret to its irresistible texture lies in the low-and-slow cooking method, which breaks down the connective tissues and fat within the pork, resulting in a succulent and juicy end product. Often seasoned with a blend of spices and sometimes marinated overnight, pulled pork can be cooked using various methods such as smoking, slow cooking, or braising, each imparting its unique touch to the meat's flavor profile.

    <p>
        The process of making pulled pork requires patience and attention to detail. Start by generously seasoning your pork shoulder with a dry rub made of spices like paprika, brown sugar, garlic powder, and a hint of cayenne pepper for some heat. Let the meat absorb these flavors by allowing it to sit in the refrigerator for several hours or overnight. When ready to cook, place the pork in a slow cooker, smoker, or oven set to a low temperature. Cook it slowly for several hours until the meat is so tender that it can be easily shredded with a fork. Once done, remove the pork from the heat, let it rest briefly, and then use two forks to pull the meat apart into delectable strands. Serve it on a bun with your favorite barbecue sauce, and enjoy a classic pulled pork sandwich that embodies the essence of Southern comfort food.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Pork Shoulder</li>
        <li>Paprika</li>
        <li>Brown Sugar</li>
        <li>Garlic Powder</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cooking Steps</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Prepare the Pork Shoulder: Start with a pork shoulder (or pork butt). Trim any excess fat if desired, but leave some for flavor and moisture during cooking.</li>
        <li>Create the Dry Rub: In a bowl, mix together 2 tablespoons of paprika, 2 tablespoons of brown sugar, 1 tablespoon of garlic powder, and 1 tablespoon of salt.</li>
        <li>Season the Pork: Generously rub the dry mixture all over the pork shoulder, ensuring it is evenly coated. Let the pork sit in the refrigerator for several hours or overnight to allow the flavors to penetrate the meat.</li>
        <li>Cook the Pork: Place the seasoned pork shoulder in a slow cooker, smoker, or oven set to a low temperature (around 225°F to 250°F). Cook it slowly for about 8-10 hours, or until the meat is tender and easily pulls apart with a fork.</li>
        <li>Shred and Serve: Once cooked, remove the pork from the heat and let it rest for about 15 minutes. Use two forks to shred the meat into strands. Serve the pulled pork on a bun with your favorite barbecue sauce or enjoy it on its own.</li>
